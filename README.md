# Color_detector
This is a Python program that uses the Tkinter library to create a GUI for detecting the main colors in an image. It allows the user to select an image file, and then displays the image and the top ten most prominent colors in that image. The color detection is performed using the colorthief library. The GUI includes a logo, a title, and two canvases for displaying the colors. The program is compatible with PNG and JPG image files, and it also provides the hex values for each of the detected colors.!
